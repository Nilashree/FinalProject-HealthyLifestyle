	Food that we consume contains the nutrition that will have an effect on the development of our body.If we consume large amount of carbohydrates withought rigorous
	physical activity in our routine , it will lead to accumulation of fats.So it's necessary that we plan our diet and consume nutrition according to our routine.
	We should also take care about the time we consume our food.

<h2>&#9752; Carbohydrates:</h2>
<p class="para2">
An individual’s optimal carb intake depends on age, gender, body composition, activity levels, personal preference, food culture and current metabolic health.
People who are physically active and have more muscle mass can tolerate  more carbs than people who are sedentary. This particularly applies for those who do a lot of high-intensity work like lifting weights or sprinting.Metabolic health is also a very important factor. When people get the metabolic syndrome, they become obese or get type II diabetes, the rules change.
People who fall into this category can’t tolerate the same amount of carbs as those who are healthy. Some scientists even refer to these problems as “carbohydrate intolerance.”

	</p>
	<p>Remember &#9757;: <mark>The optimal carb range varies between individuals, depending on activity levels, current metabolic health and a bunch of other factors.</mark></p>

<h2>&#9752; Proteins:</h2>
<p class="rightpara">
Protein at around 25-30% of calories has been shown to boost metabolism by up to 80 to 100 calories per day, compared to lower protein diets.Protein has the ability to reduce 
appetite and cause a spontaneous reduction in calorie intake. Protein is much more satiating than both fat and carbs.In a study in obese men, protein at 25% of calories increased 
feelings of fullness, reduced the desire for late-night snacking by half and reduced obsessive thoughts about food by 60%.In another study, women who increased protein intake to 30% 
of calories ended up eating 441 fewer calories per day. They also lost 11 pounds in 12 weeks, just by adding more protein to their diet (8).But protein not only  help you lose weight
,it can also help prevent you from gaining weight in the first place.In one study, just a modest increase in protein from 15% of calories to 18% of calories reduced the amount of fat 
people regained after weight loss by 50%.A high protein intake also helps to build and preserve muscle mass which burns a small amount of calories around the clock.By eating more 
protein, you will make it much easier to stick to whichever weight loss diet (be it high-carb, low-carb or something in between) you choose to follow.According to these studies, 
a protein intake around 30% of calories may be optimal for weight loss. This amounts to 150 grams per day for someone on a 2000 calorie diet.
</p>

<p>Remember &#9757;: <mark>It is important to eat enough protein if you want to gain and/or maintain muscle. Most studies suggest that 0.7 – 1 grams per pound of lean mass 
(1.5 – 2.2 grams per kg) is sufficient.</mark></p>

<h2>&#9752; Fats:</h2>
<p class="para2">
The appropriate amount of fat to eat will depend on your calorie requirements for weight loss or maintenance. It will also be based on your eating style and diet.You can use this 
calculator to determine your calorie needs to lose weight or maintain your weight. This is your daily calorie goal.A standard low-fat diet contains about 30% of calories from fat,or less.
Here are a few examples of suggested daily fat ranges for a low-fat diet, based on different calorie goals:

1,500 calories: About 50 grams of fat per day.
2,000 calories: About 67 grams of fat per day.
2,500 calories: About 83 grams of fat per day.
It’s important to note that studies show higher-fat diets, such as low-carb and Mediterranean diets, are actually much healthier than the standard low-fat diet.
</p>
<p>Remember &#9757;: <mark>How much fat you eat per day should be based on the type of diet you follow and your calorie needs for weight loss or maintenance.

<h2>&#9752; Fruits:</h2>
<p class="rightpara">

 Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Fruit sources of potassium include bananas, prunes and prune juice, dried peaches and apricots, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, and orange juice
Benefits of fruits

Eating vegetables and fruits rich in potassium as part of an overall healthy diet may lower blood pressure, and may also reduce the risk of developing kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss.

</p>
