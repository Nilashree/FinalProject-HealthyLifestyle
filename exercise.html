	and breathing rate return to resting levels much sooner from strenuous activity.
Exercise is also a key to weight control because it burns calories. If you burn off more calories than you take in, you lose weight. It's as simple as that.

<h2>&#9873; Squats:</h2>
<p  class="para2">
Squats are a full-body fitness staple that work the hips, glutes, quads, and hamstrings, 
and sneakily strengthen the core. Squats may help improve balance and coordination, as well as bone density .

 environment, which promotes body-wide muscle building.They prevent  Injuries and also helps to Boost Your Sports Performance -- Jump Higher and Run Faster.

<h2>&#9873; Lunges:</h2>
<p class="para2">
Lunges are an easy and efficient exercise to help build strength in your quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, calves, and core. 
They are also relatively safe to do as they have simple movements that are easy to follow, and lunges require no special equipment to complete.
Lunges target most, if not all, of the muscles in your lower body. 
Don't be fooled into thinking that lunges only help your legs, they also require the development of your abdominal and lower back muscles to stabilize your core and provide balance
</p>

<p style="color:brown;font-weight:bold;">Remember &#9757;:Performing additional lunges on the weaker side can help these muscles to develop at a slightly faster rate, allowing them to catch up with your stronger side. 
This will aid in sports and physical activities, as well as lower the risk of injury because of imbalance.</p>
